# nostr-oicd

NOTE: This project is still in developement. Use carefully.

This is a service that provides OIDC functionality for [NOSTR](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md). Originally thought for (Cashu Mints)[https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/21.md] clear auth.

The two main authentification functionalities available are:
- Authorication code with PKCE. 
- Device Authentification.

This service is thought to be a simpler replacement of [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak) with NOSTR first
party functionality.

This service allows for open signup using Nostr WoT. The Vertex relay is used to avoid letting Bots or fake accounts in. 

All secrets are stored securely in a keychain. The database only store fingerprints of the secrets so they can be
queried later.

## How to run

The first time you run the program you will need to run it with the `ADMIN_USER_NPUB` enviroment variable. The system
will create and administrative user to be able to login to the user dashboard.

You will be able to login to it in the `/admin/login` endpoint. After success it will redirect to the dashboard.

## Todos

- Client secret rotation and showing of secret.
- Add Google sign on.

### Support
